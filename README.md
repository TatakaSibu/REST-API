Design the REST API Endpoints:

Endpoint 1: Upload Text File

Request:
HTTP Method: POST
Path: /api/upload
Request Body: Multipart form data with a field named "file" containing the text file.
Response:
HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
Response Body: JSON object containing a message confirming successful upload.
Error Handling:
HTTP Status Code: 400 Bad Request if the request is malformed or the file is missing.
HTTP Status Code: 500 Internal Server Error if there's a server-side issue.
Endpoint 2: Retrieve Processed Results

Request:
HTTP Method: GET
Path: /api/results/{fileId}
Path Parameter: fileId (the unique identifier assigned to the uploaded file)
Response:
HTTP Status Code: 200 OK
Response Body: JSON object containing the processed results.
Error Handling:
HTTP Status Code: 404 Not Found if the fileId does not exist.
HTTP Status Code: 500 Internal Server Error if there's a server-side issue.
Implement the API Endpoints using Spring Boot:

Set up a Spring Boot project with dependencies for web, data, and possibly other necessary modules.
Implement controllers for handling the API endpoints, utilizing Spring's @RestController annotation.
Write services to handle business logic, such as file upload, processing, and retrieval.
Use Spring Data or other ORM frameworks for database interaction if needed.
Test the API Endpoints Thoroughly:

Write unit tests using JUnit and Mockito to test individual components in isolation.
Write integration tests to verify the interactions between different components.
Test edge cases and error scenarios to ensure robustness.
Consider using tools like Postman or curl for manual testing during development.
Document the API Endpoints:

Create API documentation using tools like Swagger or Spring RestDocs.
Document the purpose and usage of each endpoint, including input parameters, response formats, and error handling procedures.
Provide examples of API requests and responses for better understanding.
Update the documentation as needed to reflect changes in the API.
By following these steps, you can design, implement, test, and document the RESTful API for Enviro365's file data processing needs using Spring Boot.
